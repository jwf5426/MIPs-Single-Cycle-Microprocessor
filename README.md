# MIPs-Single-Cycle-Microprocessor

This is my Verilog project for a single-cycle MIPs processor.  The processor is able to process j, r, and i formatted MIPs instructions.  I personally wrote all the code located in frazier_lab.srcs/sources_1/new/.  For a list of capable instructions, please look at the /frazier_lab.srcs/sources_1/new/ALUControl.v file.
